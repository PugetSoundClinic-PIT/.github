We are students and faculty at the University of Washington's Information School working on applied research in the public interest. 
Our current research projects are focused broadly on computational social science, and specifically on: 
- 🤖 AI Alignment
- 🦺 Labor Policy  
- ⚖️ Local Governments  
- 🏠 Housing & Property Technology
- 💾 Open-Source Models, Hardware, and Software
- 🔬 Science of Science

We try to practice radical transparency - all of our data, software, and protocols are openly licensed and freely available for reuse (with some exceptions for human subject data).
