Welcome to the Puget Sound Clinic in Public Interest Technology!  

If you want to get involved see this page 👉 for [open researech opportunities](https://github.com/PugetSoundClinic-PIT/PugetSoundClinic-PIT.github.io/wiki) 🙌


We are students and faculty at the University of Washington's Information School working on applied research in the public interest. 
Our current research projects are focused on: 
- 🦺 Labor Policy  
- ⚖️ Civic Technology  
- 🕸 The Web
- 🔬 Science of Science

We try to practice radical transparency - all of our data, software, and protocols are openly licensed and freely avaiable for reuse (where there exists no human subject data).
