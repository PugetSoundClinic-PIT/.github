Welcome to the Puget Sound Clinic in Public Interest Technology!  

We are students and faculty at the University of Washington's Information School working on applied research in the public interest. 
Our current research projects are focused on: 
- 🦺 Platform Labor 
- ⚖️ Transparency in municipal governance 
- 🕸 Web archiving
- 🔐 Data privacy 
- 💾 Public software 

We try to practice radical transparency - all of our data, software, and protocols are openly licensed and freely avaiable for reuse (where there exists no human subject data). 
If you want to get involved with our clinic please file an issue in any repostiory and we'll be in touch 🙌
